AAC is classified as a porous, steam-cured, lightweight concrete. AAC products can be manufactured to various raw densities but are produced using the same manufacturing technology. When comparing products of various compressive strength classes, formulation differences are apparent, whereby the preliminary products used are always identical. The AAC 2-0.35 product selected for the Declaration represents the product in the lowest raw density class while the AAC 8-0.80 product represents the highest gross density class among the AAC masonry units manufactured by H+H Deutschland GmbH. An average for the AAC 2-0.35 product is formed by weighting in accordance with the annual production volume at the three locations. The AAC 8-0.80 product is only produced at one location (Wittenborn I). Application: Precision blocks, precision elements and precision panels for masonry, load-bearing and non-bearing walls.

BMB products display the same quality as non-BMB products as the product formulation is identical to that of its fossil equivalent. the form of a certificate of a standard recognised by the Renewable Energy Directive. Neopor® Plus BMB granulate is manufactured from biogas extracted from kitchen waste. The biogas used is certified in accordance with the /REDcert/ system. Directive (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies for placing the product on the market in the EU/EFTA (with the exception of Switzerland). The product requires a Declaration of Performance taking consideration of the /EN 13163:2012+A1:2015/, Thermal insulation materials for buildings - Factory-made expanded polystyrene (EPS) products - Specifications, and CE marking. Use is governed by the respective national regulations. The BMB approach applied by BASF supports the use of renewable raw materials which leads to savings in fossil resources and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The biomass used requires proof of sustainability in 2 Environmental Product Declaration BASF SE & Karl Bachl Kunststoffverarbeitung GmbH & Co.KG - Insulation board made of Neopor® Plus BMB",

Sementen består av masovnslagg, klinker, gips, ubrent kalkstein, og sementovnstøv. Klinker er brent kalkstein med mindre mengder tilsetninger, bl.a. sand",

    "description": "CLT by Stora Enso is a solid wood construction product consisting of several (3, 5, 7, or 8) bonded single-layer panels arranged at right angles to each other. The layers are bonded with carefully selected adhesives that are suitable for the respective purpose. CLT products are long-lasting and safe to use and recyclable. They are continuously tested to ensure that they meet the strictest requirements in terms of ambient air emissions. CLT also offers virtually boundless possibilities in terms of construction concept, style and architecture. Lightweight yet strong, with superior acoustic, fire, seismic, and thermal performance, CLT is currently being used in place of concrete, masonry and steel in the construction of residential, industrial and commercial buildings. Thanks to its inherent structural qualities, CLT presents no limitations to architecture. CLT resists high racking and compressive forces, so it can be especially cost-effective for multi-storey and long-span applications. Because of its dimensional stability and structural properties, this massive wooden product is well suited for floors, walls and roofs. CLT is a highly flexible wood product that is easily tailored for further processing. It can be used together with any building material. And compared with heavy mineral-based materials, CLT is easily moved by lighter cranes at the construction site. CLT is a renewable alternative to traditional construction materials that can have large environmental footprints. As trees grow – and when they are used as timber in buildings – they efficiently store carbon. This EPD has been registered as an ECO Platform EPD with ECO EPD Reference number 00001225. The International EPD System is a founding member of the ECO Platform and its procedures has undergone a peer audit to be able to use this logotype. All EPDs of construction products from different programmes that carry the ECO logotype are listed here.",
